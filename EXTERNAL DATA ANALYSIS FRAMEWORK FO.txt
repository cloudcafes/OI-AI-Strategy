Commodities Score: -5 × 10% = -0.50
Sentiment Score: -7 × 10% = -0.70
TOTAL EXTERNAL SCORE: -6.10/10 → BEARISH
<-------STEP 9: CONFLICT RESOLUTION MATRIX------->
INTERNAL vs EXTERNAL SIGNAL MATRIX:
| Option Chain | External Data | Combined Signal | Confidence | Action |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|------------|--------|
| Bullish      | Bullish       | Strong Bullish  | 85%        | Max Size, Wider Targets |
| Bearish      | Bearish       | Strong Bearish  | 85%        | Max Size, Wider Targets |
| Bullish      | Bearish       | Weak Bullish    | 45%        | Reduce Size 50%, Tighter SL |
| Bearish      | Bullish       | Weak Bearish    | 45%        | Reduce Size 50%, Tighter SL |
| Neutral      | Bullish/Bearish| External Bias   | 60%        | Base Size, Follow External |
| Any          | Neutral       | Internal Only   | 50%        | Base Size, Internal Rules |
<-------STEP 10: PROBABILITY & TRADE ADJUSTMENT------->
BASE PROBABILITY (From Option Chain): 65%
EXTERNAL CONFIRMATION ADJUSTMENT:
- Strong Consensus: +12% to Probability
- Weak/No Consensus: +0% to Probability  
- Strong Conflict: -15% to Probability
FINAL PROBABILITY: 65% + 12% = 77%
TRADE PARAMETER ADJUSTMENTS:
- Strong Consensus: Position Size +25%, SL -20pts, Target +25pts
- Weak/No Consensus: Position Size -50%, SL +30pts, Target -20pts  
- Strong Conflict: Position Size -75%, SL +50pts, Target -40pts
EXAMPLE: Strong Bearish Consensus
- Base Size: 15% → Adjusted Size: 18.75%
- Base SL: 70pts → Adjusted SL: 50pts
- Base Target: 80pts → Adjusted Target: 100pts
<-------STEP 11: EXECUTION FILTER & RISK VETO------->
- GREEKS CONFLICT FILTER: Delta-Gamma-Vanna alignment score <60% = NO TRADE
- VOLATILITY REGIME FILTER: IV Rank >85% and VoV >0.20 = Reduce Size 70%
- MICROSTRUCTURE QUALITY FILTER: Liquidity Score <10^10 + Spread >0.15 = NO TRADE
- MAJOR DATA CONFLICT: >3 contradictory signals = NO TRADE
- EXTREME VOLATILITY: VIX > 22 = Reduce Size 60%
- KEY EVENT RISK: RBI/FED meeting day = Use 50% Position Size
- GLOBAL GAP RISK: SGX move > 1.5% = Wait for 30-min consolidation
- LIQUIDITY CHECK: Bank Nifty OI < 80% average = Avoid strangles
<-------STEP 12: HIGH-FREQUENCY VALIDATION (New)------->
- Multi-timeframe Signal Convergence = (5-min + 15-min + 60-min alignment)
→ 100% convergence: Maximum confidence | 67-99%: High confidence | 33-66%: Moderate | <33%: Low confidence
